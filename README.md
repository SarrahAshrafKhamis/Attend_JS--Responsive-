# Attend_JS--Responsive-

- This is an update to old project (Attens_JS), in which I focused more on the layout and it's responsiveness, so don't mind any logical mistakes.<br/>
- If you care to check the solid backend logic, please check the last project repo (Attend_JS) > https://github.com/SarrahAshrafKhamis/Attend_JS <br/>
- Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the frontend, JS and jQuery for the backend and the localStorage as DB.<br/>

## To test the project:
1- open 'index.html' in live server <br/>
2- you can now login with admin credentials (username: skhamis, password:123), or you can register new account. <br/>
3- you will receive an email with your credentials. <br/>
4- to login, the admin must confirm your account first, you can login with admin credentials to confirm the account. <br/>
5- as an admin, you can register security man (anyone responsible with employees attendances) to try the signin/out features. <br/>
6- enjoy exploring the rest!
